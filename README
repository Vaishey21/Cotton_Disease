Cotton Leaf Disease Prediction
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to predict cotton leaf diseases. The model classifies cotton leaves into the following categories:

Bacterial Blight
Target Spot
Healthy
Curl Virus
Fusarium Wilt
The model is designed to be deployed as a web application, enabling users to upload leaf images and receive real-time predictions on the disease type.

Overview
This project aims to provide a high-accuracy model capable of diagnosing cotton leaf diseases using image classification techniques. The web application allows farmers and agronomists to easily identify and manage diseases affecting cotton plants.

Dataset
The dataset consists of images of cotton leaves categorized into five classes:

Bacterial Blight
Target Spot
Healthy
Curl Virus
Fusarium Wilt
The dataset can be sourced from agricultural image databases or Kaggle. Ensure the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets for model training.

Model Training
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Training involves the following steps:

Preprocess Images: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented (if necessary).
Model Architecture: A CNN model is designed to extract features from the images.
Training: The model is trained on the dataset to minimize classification error.
